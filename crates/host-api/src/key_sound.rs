//! Key sounds, the typing melody, commit and achievement sounds, and background music.
//!
//! One player serves the whole process, however many sessions it holds: there is one audio device, and a host with several fields open types into one of them at a time. It starts on the first call that has something switched on, not when the library loads, so the Windows TSF DLL, which links this library into every process it is injected into and never calls these functions, opens no audio device and starts no thread.
//!
//! The key path only posts a request. A session compares a generation number rather than its settings, the request goes into a bounded queue with `try_send`, so a full queue drops a sound instead of holding up a keystroke, and everything else - resolving packs, decoding, mixing - happens on the player's own thread. Samples are decoded on a thread of their own and the whole table is swapped in when it is ready, so changing packs never plays half of one and half of the other.
//!
//! Only macOS, Windows and Linux play anything here. On iOS, Android and HarmonyOS the entry points report that nothing was queued; HarmonyOS plays packs itself from the files `pack_files` and `music_pack_files` resolve.
//!
//! A failure of the audio device, or a panic anywhere in the player, turns sound off for the rest of the process with one line on standard error. A pack that does not decode is reported once and stays silent.

// Without the player the melody, the volume curve and most of the settings go unread on the platforms that do not play.
