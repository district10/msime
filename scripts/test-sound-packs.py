"""The built-in sound packs are exactly what scripts/generate_sound_packs.py synthesizes, and each one is a pack client-core accepts.

Their CC0-1.0 dedication rests on every sample being computed by that script rather than recorded or downloaded. This regenerates the samples into a temporary directory and compares them with the committed ones, so a sample edited by hand, or one dropped in from elsewhere, fails here instead of shipping under a licence nobody can vouch for. Samples are compared to within one step of 16-bit quantization, since the sines and exponentials come from the platform's libm.

Every built-in folder is also held to the limits client-core enforces on a pack, read from its source rather than copied here: the manifest's kind and id, the built-in id lists, the files a pack may hold, each sample's rate, length and size, and the melody's notes. A pack that breaks one of them is listed as an issue at runtime and never plays, on every platform at once, which only shows on a running host. The loops also have a budget of their own, because every host bundle carries them.
