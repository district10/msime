// Decodes the WAV sample at `sample` once per entry of `semitones` and writes each as `<directory>/note-<index>.wav`, 16-bit PCM at kKeySoundOutputRate, pitched by that many semitones the way host-api's player pitches a melody: by playback rate, so a note two semitones up is also shorter. The sample is refused when its header declares more than `max_millis` of audio, and a decode that yields more frames than the header declared, or none, refuses it too, so a file that lies about its length costs at most one sample's worth of memory. Only WAV is decoded: the caller plays an Ogg sample through SoundPool as it is.
